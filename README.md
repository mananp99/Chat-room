# Chat-room
A chat-room with messaging and file transfer functionalities using sockets.

Allows a client to connect to the server. Once connected the server or client can send each other messages or request for a file. Once server-client connection is made, enter 'm' to send message, 'f' to request a file, and 'x' to close the connection. It is multithreaded allowing it to send/recieve messages and files simultaneously.
